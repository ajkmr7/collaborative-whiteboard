## Installation

To setup the express server install [redis](https://redis.io/) in order to have the signal messages routed to each other properly. Once redis has been installed,you can run the `npm install .` in the directory. Create a JsonWebToken and add it to .env. Finally, run `node .` to start the server and open up a browser to create a drawing session.
